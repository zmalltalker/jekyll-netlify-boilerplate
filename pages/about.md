Everyone is looking for better technological solutions. In this process, end users are often forgotten. Technological solutions built for technology’s own sake are created every day – without consideration for the value they provide.

We want to create products you fall in love with. We find joy in creating, and we bring enthusiasm to the teams we work in. Together we build innovative solutions which help improve peoples’ lives. Our goal is to deliver more than what’s expected from us. We want to shape and improve the future.

## What we do

When we started Shortcut in 2007, we were a small team of designers and developers who wanted to work together in cross-functional teams where we solved problems together in real time. We had experienced that handovers between various professions led to lost-in-translation situations resulting in suboptimal products.


> By working together in teams we saw that the perspectives from both developers and designers into the creative process resulted in better thought-through products with happier users.

In 2007, there was no App Store and no Google Play. The iPhone wasn’t available in Norway, and all third party apps were restricted to running in the browser on the phone.

After the App Store launched in 2008, we quickly approached Norwegian companies with ideas for apps they could give their end users. We were thrilled when our first app, Trafikanten, was launched the same year that the App Store was launched, and wanted to build more apps for this wonderful device and platform.

Through the last ten years we have effectively become an app company, building apps for all the phone platforms used by the public. As the apps have become mission critical for our customers we have kept growing as a company, both in terms of widening our competencies and employing more people. Today we have all kinds of people working with app development, digital design, process management, cloud architecture, backend development and machine learning – all the things required to build great app experiences. All the kinds of skills which can help us build better apps.

We are so proud of all our wonderful colleagues and all the amazing work they do. We have built more than 200 apps and we’re constantly trying to help our customers use apps to provide better service to their end users.

## Development
A majority of our colleagues are developers. We believe we have the strongest technical expertise in iOS and Android in Norway. In addition to specialists in either Android or iOS we also have quite a few generalists on the team, with expertise in backend development, frontend/full stack development and integration. What’s really important for all our developers is that they play an as important role in creative processes as the designers.

At Shortcut you will meet developers who have a passion for solving the problems end users struggle with.

## Design
As design has become more and more strategically important for companies, the scope of design as a profession has exploded. Where designers ten years ago would either specialize in UX or UI, new professions like service design, strategic design and digital design have emerged since then. Our design team has people with preference and specialist skills in all these professions, but in order to retain a streamlined brand and user experience it is important for us that our designers are able to see the big picture.

This holistic approach to design means no handovers between designers with specialist skills and a deep understanding of digital from all designers.

## Cloud
In our quest to build better apps we keep looking for the things that will enable us to build even better user experiences. What we have seen is that high-performing, scalable, extendable and cost-efficient backend services and platforms raises the bar for what kind of digital experiences our customers can give to their end users. We believe that cloud services can enable all of this, and have built a team of cloud architects to help our customers in their cloud transformation journey. Although we have colleagues with skills and experience from all cloud platforms on the market we have invested in becoming a Google Cloud Platform partner. We can help you with cloud infrastructure, cloud app development and data/machine learning.

We believe digital platforms will keep becoming more important as more platforms (voice, web, TVs, cars…) arrive.

## Innovation and process management
Building digital products is a vital part of any organization’s digital transformation. But digital transformation isn’t just about building stuff, it’s just as much about adjusting your organization, defining business goals to be realized by digital products and ensuring that the digital products make sense in a business perspective is equally important. Ultimately we want to help our customers solve business problems, not just build stuff. Our non-technical colleagues will challenge your business and our teams, trying to help the team deliver on business goals, not production goals. With our ten years of experience in building apps we have learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t, and what kinds of challenges face organizations entering into a digital transformation.

We’d love to share this experience with you.
